# TicTacToeByChatgptO1
TicTacToe game created By Chatgpt O1 , This repo will be all files suggested by the ai
This game is fully created by open ai o1
The game is good , ai makes small mistakes like in view I fix turn message using this code
<code>
it is {{this.currentPlayer.symbol}}'s turn
</code>

also I fix the value of the cell by
<code>
{{ cell.value }}
</code>
instead of
<code>
{{cell}}
</code>
it was showing [object]

also
i fix the below checks for select cell , it writes the method onSelectPiece but not used it.
<code>
else if (this.currentPlayer.count >= 3) {
    
        
        this.onSelectPiece(rowIndex,colIndex);
        
    }
    else
    {

        // Otherwise, handle placing a piece if the player hasn't placed all 3
        this.handlePlace(rowIndex, colIndex);
    }
</code>

I hope you enjoy the game , I like it
